# Experimentation Guidelines

## Project Goals
- Understand/experiment with cutting-edge tools (LangChain, LangGraph, LangSmith, Pydantic, MCP)
- Create a reusable template for personal projects  
- Invent novel paradigms: E.g., a "meta-swarm optimizer" that uses reinforcement learning to evolve agent configurations

## Novel Concepts Being Explored

### Swarm Intelligence Paradigms
- **Dynamic Sub-Swarm Spawning**: Agents automatically spawn parallel sub-agents for complex tasks (e.g., sharded data processing)
- **Consensus-Based Iteration**: Multi-model voting and debate mechanisms for quality assurance
- **MCP-Infused Tool Swarm**: Tools self-expose via MCP servers, enabling dynamic discovery and structured calls

### Advanced Features
- **Debate Swarmlets**: Sub-debates for contentious pipeline steps, scaling to ensemble validation
- **Quantum-Inspired Branching**: Probabilistic pipeline optimization (future exploration)
- **Adaptive Sharding**: Automatic parallelization based on dataset complexity thresholds

## Update Protocol
1. Propose changes via discussion
2. Update relevant documentation sections
3. Test changes thoroughly
4. Document impact on scalability and performance

## Creativity Prompts
For each update, consider:
- **Scalable innovations**: How does this change improve handling of massive datasets?
- **Novel AI paradigms**: Are we pioneering new multi-agent collaboration patterns?
- **Production readiness**: What hooks exist for cloud integration?

## Data Engineering Focus
All experiments must tie back to practical data engineering workflows:
- ETL/ELT pipeline automation
- Data quality validation and consensus
- Schema discovery and adaptation
- Streaming data integration (future: Kafka, event-driven processing)

## Extension Points
- **Cloud Integration**: AWS Lambda for agent parallelism, S3 for large datasets
- **Distributed Systems**: Kubernetes for swarm orchestration  
- **Advanced RAG**: Neo4j integration for graph-based schema relationships
- **Monitoring**: LangSmith traces, observability dashboards

## Research Areas
- Multi-agent consensus mechanisms in data pipelines
- Dynamic tool discovery and composition via MCP
- Hybrid human-AI pipeline validation workflows
- Reinforcement learning for agent configuration optimization
